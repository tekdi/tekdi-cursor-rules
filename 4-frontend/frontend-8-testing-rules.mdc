# Frontend Testing & Quality Rules

## Testing Strategy and Organization

### Test Pyramid Structure
- Write more unit tests than integration tests, more integration than e2e tests
- Focus unit tests on business logic and pure functions
- Use integration tests for component interactions
- Reserve e2e tests for critical user flows only
- Keep tests focused and isolated

### Test Organization and Structure
- Co-locate tests with source code
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep test setup minimal and focused

## Component Testing Best Practices

### Testing User Interactions
- Test components from user perspective
- Focus on behavior rather than implementation
- Use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Test user interactions and state changes
- Verify component outputs and side effects

### Mocking and Test Isolation
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Keep mocks simple and focused
- Reset mocks between tests
- Mock at the right level (module, function, or service)
- Use dependency injection for easier testing

## Integration Testing

### Component Integration
- Test how components work together
- Verify data flow between parent and child components
- Test context providers and consumers
- Test routing and navigation flows
- Validate form submissions end-to-end

### API Integration Testing
- Test API integration with real or mocked endpoints
- Verify request/response handling
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Validate data transformation
- Test loading and error states

## Code Quality Standards

### Code Organization and Structure
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions
- Group related functionality together
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling

### Type Safety and Validation
- Use type systems when available (TypeScript, PropTypes)
- Validate function parameters and return values
- Document expected data structures
- Implement runtime type checking for critical paths
- Use schema validation for complex data

### Error Handling and Debugging

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries for component errors
- Handle async operation failures gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Implement fallback mechanisms

### Debugging and Development Tools
- Implement helpful development warnings
- Add debug logging for complex operations
- Use meaningful variable names and comments
- Create debugging utilities for testing
