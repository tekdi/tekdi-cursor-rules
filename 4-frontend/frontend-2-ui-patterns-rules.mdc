# Frontend UI/UX Patterns Rules

## Responsive Design Patterns

### Mobile-First Development
- Start all layouts with mobile viewport constraints
- Use relative units (rem, em, %, vw, vh) over fixed pixels
- Design touch-friendly interfaces from the ground up
- Test components across multiple viewport sizes during development
- Implement progressive enhancement for larger screens

### Flexible Layout Systems
- Use CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts
- Use Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts
- Avoid fixed widths on container elements
- Implement fluid spacing with CSS custom properties
- Design components to reflow gracefully at any viewport size

### Breakpoint Management
- Define semantic breakpoint variables (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use consistent breakpoint values across the project
- Avoid magic numbers in media queries
- Create utility classes for responsive behavior
- Document breakpoint decisions in comments

## User Interface Patterns

### Consistent Interaction States
- Define hover, focus, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements
- Use consistent timing for state transitions (150-300ms)
- Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions
- Implement loading states for async operations
- Maintain state consistency across similar components

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use size, color, and spacing to establish clear hierarchy
- Apply consistent spacing scale throughout the interface
- Ensure important elements have sufficient visual weight
- Group related content with proximity and visual cues
- Use typography scale to reinforce content hierarchy

### Empty and Error State Design
- Show skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Provide progress feedback for multi-step processes
- Design meaningful empty states with clear actions
- Design error states with clear recovery actions

## Form Design Patterns

### Input Design
- Label all form inputs clearly and descriptively
- Use appropriate input types for data (email, tel, date)
- Implement placeholder text as hints, not replacements for labels
- Group related fields with fieldsets and legends
- Show input format requirements upfront

### Form Validation and Accessibility
- Show inline validation feedback near relevant fields
- Use clear, actionable error messages for form validation
- Validate on blur for individual fields
- Preserve user input when showing validation errors
- Highlight form fields that need attention with visual indicators
- Associate labels with form controls using for/id attributes
- Provide clear instructions before form fields
- Use fieldsets and legends for grouped inputs
- Mark required fields clearly and consistently

### Progressive Disclosure
- Show only essential fields initially
- Reveal additional options contextually
- Use progressive steps for complex forms
- Implement accordion patterns for optional sections
- Keep forms as concise as possible

## Animation and Motion Patterns

### Performance-Conscious Animation
- Use CSS transforms for animations (translateX, scale, rotate)
- Leverage GPU acceleration with transform3d() or will-change
- Keep animation duration under 300ms for UI feedback
- Use easing curves that feel natural (ease-out for entrances)
- Provide reduced-motion alternatives

### Meaningful Motion
- Use animation to guide user attention to important changes
- Animate state transitions smoothly to maintain context
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Ensure animations enhance rather than distract from content
- Provide clear entry and exit animations for modals/overlays

## Touch and Gesture Patterns

### Touch Target Optimization
- Make interactive elements at least 44x44 pixels
- Add sufficient padding around clickable items
- Account for thumb reach zones on mobile devices
- Prevent accidental touches with appropriate spacing
- Use visual feedback for touch interactions

### Gesture Support
- Support common touch gestures (tap, swipe, pinch)
- Provide visual feedback during gesture recognition
- Don't rely solely on gestures for core functionality
- Test for conflicts with browser default gestures
- Implement gesture timeouts for failed attempts

## Navigation Patterns

### Clear Navigation Hierarchy
- Implement consistent navigation patterns across the interface
- Use breadcrumbs for deep navigation structures
- Provide clear indicators for current location
- Ensure navigation is keyboard accessible
- Structure navigation with clear visual hierarchy

### Menu and Dropdown Patterns
- Support both mouse and keyboard navigation
- Implement proper focus management for dropdown menus
- Use ARIA attributes for screen reader support
- Provide clear visual indicators for expandable items
- Handle menu positioning for edge cases (viewport boundaries)

## Content Patterns

### Typography and Readability
- Use adequate line height (1.4-1.6) for body text
- Implement proper content hierarchy with heading levels
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text
- Use consistent text alignment and spacing
- Support user font size preferences

### Image and Media Handling
- Implement responsive images with appropriate srcset attributes
- Use lazy loading for images below the fold
- Provide alternative text for all meaningful images
- Optimize image formats and sizes for web delivery
- Handle loading and error states for media content

## Accessibility-First Patterns

### Screen Reader Optimization
- Add descriptive labels for interactive elements
- Announce dynamic content changes with live regions
- Provide context for complex interactions
- Design interfaces that work well with assistive technologies

## Performance UI Patterns

### Perceived Performance
- Show content immediately, even if incomplete
- Use optimistic UI updates for user actions
- Implement skeleton screens during data loading
- Provide immediate feedback for user interactions
- Use progressive enhancement for non-critical features

### Efficient Updates
- Minimize DOM manipulation and reflows
- Use event delegation for dynamic content
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Batch DOM updates when possible
- Optimize CSS selectors for performance
