# Frontend Data & State Management Rules

## State Management Principles

### State Ownership and Boundaries
- Keep state as close to its usage as possible
- Lift state up only when multiple components genuinely need access
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2-3 component levels
- Clearly define state ownership at component boundaries
- Use context or state management libraries for deeply nested sharing

### Immutability Patterns
- Treat all state as immutable - never mutate existing state objects
- Use spread operators for shallow object/array updates
- Implement pure update functions for state transformations
- Use immutability helper libraries for complex nested updates
- Return new references when state changes

### State Types and Separation
- Distinguish between UI state and business/domain state
- Separate local component state from global application state
- Handle server state differently from client state
- Compute derived state rather than storing it
- Keep state structure flat to avoid nested update complexity

## Data Flow Architecture

### Unidirectional Data Flow
- Data flows down through props/attributes
- Events and actions flow up through callbacks
- Avoid two-way data binding patterns when possible
- Make data flow explicit and traceable
- Use event emitters or observable patterns for complex communications

### Action Patterns
- Use descriptive action names that explain intent
- Keep actions pure and predictable
- Separate action creators from business logic
- Handle async operations with consistent patterns
- Implement proper error handling for actions

## State Persistence

### Local Storage Management
- Persist critical user state across browser sessions
- Serialize and deserialize state properly
- Handle storage quota limits gracefully
- Sync state across browser tabs when necessary
- Clear sensitive data appropriately

### Session Management
- Clear sensitive data on logout
- Handle session expiration gracefully
- Restore appropriate state after page refresh
- Implement proper state hydration
- Handle authentication state changes

## Data Validation

### State Integrity
- Ensure state transitions are valid
- Prevent invalid state combinations
- Log state violations for debugging
- Implement state invariants
