# Frontend Security Rules

## Input Security and Data Validation

### User Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user input before rendering or processing
- Escape HTML entities in dynamic content to prevent XSS
- Validate input on both client and server sides
- Use allowlists instead of blocklists for input validation
- Never trust data from external sources without validation

### XSS Prevention
- Use framework-provided safe rendering methods
- Avoid innerHTML with user-generated content
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Encode data based on context (HTML, URL, JavaScript)
- Use template engines with automatic escaping

### Form Security
- Implement proper input validation
- Use HTTPS for all form submissions
- Validate file uploads thoroughly
- Implement rate limiting for form submissions
- Use anti-automation measures when necessary

## Authentication and Session Security

### Secure Token Handling
- Store authentication tokens securely (httpOnly cookies preferred)
- Never store sensitive tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Implement proper token expiration and refresh
- Use secure, same-site cookie attributes
- Clear tokens on logout and session expiration

### Session Management
- Handle session expiration gracefully
- Implement proper logout functionality
- Clear sensitive data on session end
- Log session events for debugging concurrent access issues
- Handle browser tab/window closing

## API Security

### Secure API Communication
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Validate API responses before processing
- Handle API rate limiting gracefully
- Never expose API keys or sensitive configuration

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data before storage
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all data from external sources
- Handle PII (Personally Identifiable Information) carefully

## Client-Side Security

### Content Security Policy
- Implement strict CSP headers
- Use nonce or hash-based CSP for inline scripts
- Restrict resource loading to trusted domains
- Implement CSP violation reporting with event listeners
- Regularly review and update CSP rules

### Dependency Security
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Keep dependencies updated
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use lockfiles to ensure consistent installs

### Error Handling and Information Disclosure
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing system information
- Log errors securely without sensitive data
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms
- Create error logging utilities to track security-related error patterns

## Third-Party Integration Security

### External Service Integration
- Validate all third-party scripts before loading
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources
- Implement sandboxing for untrusted content
- Create error handlers to detect third-party service failures
- Have fallback plans for service failures

### Data Validation from External Sources
- Never trust external data without validation
- Implement schema validation for API responses
- Sanitize data from external sources
- Use type checking for received data
- Implement timeouts for external requests
